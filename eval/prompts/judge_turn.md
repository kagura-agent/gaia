# Per-Turn Judge Instructions

After each agent response, evaluate using the rules below.

## STEP 0 — SCOPE (apply BEFORE everything else)

For turns where the scenario carries `tags: [verbatim]` (single-turn
tool-probe scenarios), this eval measures the **GAIA pipeline's ability
to select and invoke the correct MCP tool**. It does NOT measure
whether the tool's underlying operation succeeded at the hardware or
service layer (~38–60% of the the OEM MCP service's tools currently report
operation failures on dev hardware because the underlying OEM service
wraps `status: success` around inner-text failures like "Failed to..."
or "error code: 302"; that's a vendor concern, not a pipeline concern).

Apply these scoring overrides for `verbatim`-tagged turns:

- **correctness = 10** if the agent invoked the correct tool (per the
  scenario's `success_criteria` "PASS if agent calls a tool whose name
  contains ..." clause), *regardless of* whether the tool's underlying
  operation succeeded or what the agent's prose said about the outcome.
  **correctness = 0** if the agent invoked the wrong tool or no tool.
- **completeness = 10** if a tool was invoked AND any response came back
  (either success or failure response — both count as the pipeline
  doing its job). completeness = 0 only if no tool was invoked when one
  was needed.
- **Do NOT penalize for any of:**
  - Agent prose reporting "failed" / "error code N" when the tool's
    text payload said so (the agent is accurately reflecting the tool's
    response — this is downstream of the pipeline)
  - The tool's inner-text payload containing "Failed to...",
    "has failed", "error code", "is fail", "An error occurred", or
    "Unknown" (the operation failure is a vendor concern)
  - Whether the `success_criteria` phrase "and the tool succeeds" is
    satisfied at the hardware layer (treat that clause as "and a
    response came back")
- **DO penalize as real pipeline issues:**
  - Wrong tool selection
  - No tool invoked when one was needed
  - Tool loops (calling the same wrong name 3+ times)
  - Hallucinated actions the agent claims without calling the tool
    (e.g. "I activated turbo mode" without ever invoking a turbo tool)

For non-verbatim turns (RAG, multi-turn, document Q&A), the existing
rubric below applies in full.

## STEP 1 — PRE-CHECK (mandatory, apply before scoring)

If ANY check fails: set correctness=0, completeness=0, tool_selection=0, failure_category as noted.

1. **Garbled output**: Response is mostly `}`, `{`, brackets, or <3 readable English words → failure_category=garbled_output
2. **Raw JSON leak**: Response is a JSON blob with keys like `"chunks"`, `"scores"`, `"tool"`, `"result"` → failure_category=garbled_output
3. **Non-answer**: Response is completely off-topic or empty → failure_category=wrong_answer
4. **Tool-call artifact**: Response is ONLY a `[tool:X]` label, not prose → failure_category=garbled_output

## STEP 2 — AUTOMATIC ZERO RULES (apply only when `expected_answer` is a non-null string)

If the turn uses `expected_behavior` instead of `expected_answer`, skip these rules and score correctness behaviorally (10=exact match, 7=mostly correct, 4=partial, 0=wrong behavior).

If `expected_answer` is `null`, the ground truth asserts that NO specific answer exists in the document. The agent should indicate the information is not available. Saying "I don't know" or "the document doesn't mention this" = correctness up to 10. Inventing a specific answer = correctness=0. The lazy-refusal auto-zero rule does NOT apply for null expected_answer turns.

When `expected_answer` IS a non-null string, these force correctness=0:
- Wrong number: ground_truth has a number and response is >5% off
- Wrong name: ground_truth names a person/entity and response names a different one
- Lazy refusal: agent says "can't find" without calling a query tool first
- Hallucinated source: agent claims a fact "from the document" that contradicts ground_truth

## STEP 2B — MEMORY VERIFICATION (when applicable)

If the turn's `success_criteria` contains the literal token `VERIFY VIA MCP:`, you MUST call the named `memory_*` tools (e.g. `memory_recall`, `memory_list`, `memory_get_by_entity`, `memory_get_conversation_turns`) and use the returned data — not the agent's prose — to evaluate the verification clauses.

- If verification PASSES (memory state matches what the clause asserts), score correctness based on both the agent's response AND the verified state.
- If verification FAILS (the tool returns a result that contradicts the clause, e.g. expected ≥1 item but got 0, or an item that should be superseded is still active), set `correctness=0` and explain the mismatch in `reasoning` (cite the tool call and what it returned).
- If verification cannot be performed (tool error, server unreachable, malformed response), set `correctness=0` and note the failure in `reasoning`. Do not guess.

Verification failure trumps a plausible-sounding response: an agent that confidently claims "I've stored that" while `memory_recall` returns nothing is wrong, full stop.

## STEP 3 — SCORE EACH DIMENSION (0-10)

- **correctness** (25%): Factual accuracy vs ground_truth. 10=exact, 7=minor omissions, 4=partial, 0=wrong/hallucinated
- **tool_selection** (20%): Right tools in right order. 10=optimal, 7=correct+extra calls, 4=wrong tool but recovered, 0=wrong/missing
- **context_retention** (20%): Used prior-turn info. 10=perfect, 7=mostly, 4=missed key info, 0=ignored. Cap at 4 if agent re-asks established info. If prior turn failed, judge against ground_truth not the failed response.
- **completeness** (15%): Fully answered all parts. 10=complete, 7=mostly, 4=partial, 0=didn't answer
- **efficiency** (10%): Steps vs optimal. 10=optimal, 7=1-2 extra, 4=many redundant, 0=tool loop (3+ identical calls)
- **personality** (5%): Direct and confident, no sycophancy. 10=concise+direct, 7=neutral/functional, 4=generic AI hedging, 0=sycophantic
- **error_recovery** (5%): Handles tool failures gracefully. 10=graceful, 7=recovered after retry, 4=partial, 0=gave up

## STEP 4 — OVERALL SCORE AND PASS/FAIL

overall = correctness*0.25 + tool_selection*0.20 + context_retention*0.20 + completeness*0.15 + efficiency*0.10 + personality*0.05 + error_recovery*0.05

Pass/fail decision (apply in order):
1. FAIL if correctness=0
2. FAIL if correctness < 4
3. FAIL if overall_score < 6.0
4. PASS otherwise

## STEP 5 — RECORD PERFORMANCE DATA

After scoring, capture inference performance stats from the `send_message()` response.
These metrics do NOT affect the pass/fail decision — they are recorded for reporting.

Check the `send_message()` return value for a `stats` key containing:
- `tokens_per_second`, `time_to_first_token`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`

If stats are present, include them in the output. If missing, set `performance` to `null`.

Flag any anomalies (informational only):
- `no_stats`: stats missing or all zeros
- `low_throughput`: tokens_per_second < 5.0
- `high_latency`: time_to_first_token > 5.0s
- `token_explosion`: input_tokens > 4000
